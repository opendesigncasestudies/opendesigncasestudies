# Open Design Case Studies
The Open Design Case Studies (ODCS) repository aims to crowdsource, curate, and recruit other educators to contribute case studies for teaching software design courses. The platform will also allow educators and students to share, brainstorm, and discuss design solutions based on case studies shared publicly on the repository

We propose a [template](https://github.com/opendesigncasestudies/odcs-template) for contributors to share their real-world software design case studies on GitHub to aid in curriculum design.
